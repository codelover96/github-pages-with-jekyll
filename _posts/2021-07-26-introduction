# Introduction
My blog posts are built using Github Pages and Jekyll.
You can create your own blog with Github Pages using [this guide](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages)

Generally my blog posts will have a how-to attidude and showcase how I have built things.
Otherwise I will just post about interesting projects of mine or other's.
